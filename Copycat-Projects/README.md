Because it is hard for me to come up with ideas naturally, and because I want to strengthen my skills in javascript and python, I have decided to code a bunch of copycat projects. Since I am following tutorials, the code itself will not be posted here. What _will_ be posted here, however, will be commentary on the code itself as well as what I learned from the project.

My main goal with this ongoing project is to not only strengthen my programming skills by building practical applications, but to be able to convey concepts that I learn easily to a third party.

This project is in the middle of a revamp, so there are currently many WIPS present in the folders.
